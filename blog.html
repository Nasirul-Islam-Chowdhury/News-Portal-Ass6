    <h1 class=" text-center d-inline">1.What is Difference Between Var, Let and Const in JavaScript?</h1>
    <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">let: </h4>The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly 
    braces {}.</h5>
    
    <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">Var: </h4>The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.</h5>
    
        <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">Const: </h4> The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</h5><br>
