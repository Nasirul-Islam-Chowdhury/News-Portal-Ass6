        <h2 class=" text-center d-inline">(1) What is Difference Between Var, Let and Const in JavaScript?</h2>
    <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">let: </h4>The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly 
    braces {}.</h5>
    
    <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">Var: </h4>The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.</h5>
    
        <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">Const: </h4> The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can't be reassigned.
            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that's a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables – just ones that can't be reassigned.</h5><br>

        <h2 class=" text-center d-inline">(2) What is Difference Between Arrow Function And Regular in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p class="my-3">1. In regular function, this value is dynamic, In arrow function it equals to this of the outer function.</p>
            <p class="my-3">2. In regular function, arguments will give you list of parameter passed in function, In arrow function arguments is not defined.</p>
            <p class="my-3">3. In regular function, you always have to return any value, but in Arrow function you can skip return keyword and write in single line.</p>
            <p class="my-3">4. In arrow function parameters should be unique.</p>
            <p class="my-3">5. Hoisting matters in arrow function as function get not be invoked before initialisations.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-center d-inline my-5">(3) .forEach(), .map(), .filter() .... What's the difference?</h2>

        <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">.forEach: </h4>It is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</h5>
            
            <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">.map(): </h4>It executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</h5>
            
                <h5><h4 class="d-inline text-decoration-underline">.filter(): </h4>It checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</h5><br>

        <h2 class=" text-center d-inline my-5 ">(4) Why Should We Use Template Literals?</h2>
        <p class="my-3">Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p><br>
